```{r readfiles, include=FALSE}

f_lord <- read_csv(file.path("Assignment_LOTR_545_files", "lotr-tidy-master", "data", "The_Fellowship_Of_The_Ring.csv"))


r_lord <- read_csv(file.path("Assignment_LOTR_545_files", "lotr-tidy-master", "data", "The_Return_Of_The_King.csv")) 
  


two_lord <- read_csv(file.path("Assignment_LOTR_545_files", "lotr-tidy-master", "data", "The_Two_Towers.csv"))  
  
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
