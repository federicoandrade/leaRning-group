```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```


```{r}
library(gapminder)

qdiff3 <- function(x, probs = c(0, 1)) {
  stopifnot(is.numeric(x))
  the_quantiles <- quantile(x, probs)
  max(the_quantiles) - min(the_quantiles)
}

```

#### 20.4 Be proactive about NAs
Many built-in R functions have an na.rm = argument through which you can specify how you want to handle NAs. Typically the default value is na.rm = FALSE and typical default behavior is to either let NAs propagate or to raise an error.


```{r}

z <- gapminder$lifeExp
z[3] <- NA

quantile(gapminder$lifeExp)

#quantile(z)
# does not allow to use it. 

quantile(z, na.rm =TRUE)

```
NOTE> So quantile() simply will not operate in the presence of NAs unless na.rm = TRUE.
